## Hi, I am Elisabeth Mortensen! 👋

I'm Elisabeth, a dedicated Analyst/Data Scientist based in New York City. My passion lies in the secret simplicity of numbers and their profound ability to unlock insights about our world. As an analytical thinker, I relish the opportunity to work with large amounts of data, embracing the complexities and challenges inherent in the field of mathematics. Or, in other words, you give me a bucket of data, and I return a Jupyter notebook full of insights!
